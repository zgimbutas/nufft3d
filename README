This directory contains Fortran code for the 3D NUFFT.

It is asymptotically fast, but the performance
of this library is noticeably worse than that of the FFT.
Significant (but understood) implementation effort are
required to accelerate this code.

dirft3d.f contains direct evaluation schemes for verification/testing.

nufft3df90.f contains NUFFT routines of types 1,2,3 with dynamic F90 
workspace allocation.

nufft3df77.f contains NUFFT routines of types 1,2,3 with static F77 
workspace allocation in the calling (driver) routine.

next235.f contains a utility routine that finds a highly composite 
integer greater than a given number. 
IT IS THE SAME AS THE ROUTINE PROVIDED IN THE 1D LIBRARY.

dfftpack.f contains a double precision FFT package from Netlib.

nufft3d_demof77.f contains a sample driver routine for the F77
versions of the codes. 

nufft3d_demof90.f contains the analogous driver for the F90
versions of the codes.
